        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Simple fish and chips made with cod fillets and twice-fried fries. Tastes great as-is or with malt vinegar, lemon, or tartar sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds cod fillets</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.  </li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Drain and pat dry potatoes. Fry in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, and place in hot oil. Fry fish in batches until golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry potatoes again in hot oil until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.</li>
            
        </ol>
